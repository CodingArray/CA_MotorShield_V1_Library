CA_MotorShield Library Copyright Notice:

Copyright (c) [2024], CodingArray / hanol JU. All rights reserved. 
This library is based on the Adafruit_MotorShield v2 library from Adafruit Industries 
and the PCA9685_RT library from Rob Tillaart, integrating the strengths of both libraries 
to address issues arising during DC motor operation with I2C communication errors and 
when changing the motor's rotation direction encountered with the Adafruit_MotorShield v2 library. 
Such issues were particularly evident in the 'void Adafruit_MotorShield::setPin(uint8_t pin, boolean value)' 
function, where setting multiple pins to HIGH or LOW caused problems.
